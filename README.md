### Why reinvent the wheel?
The reason everything is written from scratch is because we were not allowed to use any framework, I (Joris Rietveld)
never realy understood how to roll out a MVC system, template engine or how to do dynamic routing so I decided this was
a great oppertunity to learn these consepts by implementing it my self. I realy learned a lot about architecture, Object 
oriented design, being way to optimistic about the amount of time it takes to do `it` correct... and the importance of 
**Unit Testing!** instead of creating ten 500 liner classes and trying to figure out why they don't work...

I leaned a lot, figured out that the teachers that talked about testing, object oriented design, writing documentation and 
properly using version management were proberly right... and it might be that someone that has 10 years more experience 
know something your not
